* !Collapse class results with mean (having 100 plots won't work for cifar100 for example)
    * Mean over classes => stratified measure vs non stratified
* !Collapse layer results with mean => simpler graphs
* Try with resnet, vgg, other invariant models
    *
* Fully trained vs untrained network? ie, how invariance evolves, snapshots :D
    * Retrained networks invariance before-after
* Move to fully automated exp scripts, leave jupyter
